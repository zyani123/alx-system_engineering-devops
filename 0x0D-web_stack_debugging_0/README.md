# Debugging

* The Webstack debugging series trained me the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

* Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

*  In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks were given to me, the final goal was to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. 
*  But before writing this Bash script, I figured out what is going on and fix it manually
